[since 1.1 Final]
"allowMouseWheel": Boolean (default true)
Self explaining...

"multiSelectionDelimiter": String (default ',')

Remembery Keynavigation works only when the datepicker has got focus which isnt always the case in some browsers

V0.9 Beta [2008/04/05]
Initial Release:
Joined the extensions together nicely and added even more features:
- fixed some bugs/improved the original extensions a bit
- works on Original DateMenu and DateField (Ext.ux.DateFieldPlus) also
- Definable Multimonths (rows,amount,fill..)
- Custom CSS for definable days
- Weeknumber Display
- Weekend CSS Styling
- National Holidays CSS Styling
- Quicktip support
- Function based custom displayed days
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single days (when clicked on a date)
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single weeks (when clicked on a weeknumber)
- Multiselection support by CTRL-Key to add single months (when clicked on the weeknumber header)
- Multiselection support by SHIFT-Key to add a range of days depending on the lastclicked day (when clicked on a single date)
- returned the prev/next monthbuttons to the monthlabelrow
- implemented mousewheel-event again for comfortable increasing/decreasing months
- implemented monthpicker again to comfortably select the starting month. the monthpicker is rendered on the very first monthname so with only 1 month given, it acts just like the original datepicker
- added quick dayselection routine without calling update() every time. MUCH faster selection, especially when using huge multimonth calendars!
- added "OK"- and "Undo"-Buttons when multiSelection is set to true
- unneccessary renderupdate trigger eliminated (performance-leak on huge multimonthcalendars!) (setvalue-function changed, much more faster now)
- prevented opening a new browsertab in IE7/IE8 when CTRL multiselecting (occured in original multimonth calendar extension and datepicker also if clicked on an empty area within the cell) (default behaviour for a-tags, prevented this by CSS)
- extend keynavigation (RETURN=ok-Button, CTRL as usual)
- added Tooltip functionality to DateFieldPlus just like Buttons (tooltip show on triggerbutton only, this way invalidtext tooltips stay intact)
