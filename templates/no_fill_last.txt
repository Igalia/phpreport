Hello ###LOGIN###,

Last week you didn't record any task in the days ###LIST_OF_DATES###.

PHPReport automatically locks days more than 2 weeks in the past,
so in three days time, you will not be able to record hours for the
days that you have not filled in. In order to unlock these locked days
you will need to talk to the Project Managers to explain why you
failed to record hours for this month.

Best regards,
