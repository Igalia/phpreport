# How to set up LDAP authentication

The implementation of LDAP authentication connectors is robust, but its
configuration is a bit \"hackish\". In any case, if you want to go on
you need to edit the file [config/config.php]{.title-ref} as explained
below.

As a precondition, you will need an extra dependency in your system:

- Debian: php-ldap
- Ubuntu/Fedora/RHEL: php-ldap

First, locate the following block of lines and edit them according to
your LDAP server settings:

    // LDAP connection configuration

    /**
     * @name LDAP_SERVER
     * @global string LDAP server ip or name
     */
    define('LDAP_SERVER', 'localhost');

    /**
     * @name LDAP_PORT
     * @global int LDAP server port
     */
    define('LDAP_PORT', 389);

    /**
     * @name LDAP_BASE
     * @global string LDAP base OIDs
     */
    define('LDAP_BASE', 'dc=igalia,dc=com');

After that, locate the following block of lines and uncomment them to
enable the code that implements LDAP authentication in PhpReport (don't
modify the content of the lines, only uncomment them):

    // uncomment the next lines to enable LDAP user authentication

    /**
     * @name USER_DAO
     * @global string User DAO implementation used
     */
    define('USER_DAO', 'HybridUserDAO');
    /**
     * @name USER_GROUP_DAO
     * @global string User Group DAO implementation used
     */
    define('USER_GROUP_DAO', 'LDAPUserGroupDAO');
    /**
     * @name BELONGS_DAO
     * @global string Belongs DAO implementation used
     */
    define('BELONGS_DAO', 'LDAPBelongsDAO');

    // end lines for LDAP user authentication

You might need to modify two more lines at
[config/config.php]{.title-ref} to match your LDAP group structure. The
following code indicates which is the name of the most basic group of
users, the one that contains all the members that will use PhpReport:

    /**
     * @name ALL_USERS_GROUP
     * @global string users group used for retrieving all users
     */
    define('ALL_USERS_GROUP', 'staff');

You can also define a group to display only active employees based on
its respective LDAP group:

    /**
     * @name EMPLOYEES_GROUP
     * @global string users group used for retrieving all active employees
     */
    define('EMPLOYEES_GROUP', 'employees');

And in this line you must indicate a list with the names of the user
groups that will have some meaning for PhpReport:

    /**
     * @name USER_GROUPS
     * @global string all user groups for displaying on the interfaces as
     * a serialized array, compulsory when using LDAP user authentication
     */
    define('USER_GROUPS', serialize(array('staff', 'admin')));

Once you have set the groups up, you can specify the pages and web
services each group is allowed to enter modifying the file
[config/permission.php]{.title-ref}. Usually you would like to have a
_staff_ and an _admin_ group so you would only need to modify that file
to replace the default group names with the actual ones.

Finally, take into account that users must still exist both in your
database and your LDAP server, and in this state of the configuration
you cannot log into PhpReport because users don't fulfill both
conditions. You should log into your database and add users manually
with the following commands:

    psql -h localhost -W -U phpreport phpreport

    insert into usr(login) values ('username1');
    insert into usr(login) values ('username2');
    etc.
