The first option in PhpReport top menu points to the task management
screen. In this screen, users will be able to fill in their tasks,
modify or delete them.

The tasks management screen
---------------------------

![](i/tasks-screen.png)

In the left column, you can find:

-   User work summary: contains useful information about the user work
    status.
-   Calendar: indicates the selected date and you can click on it to go
    to a different date.
-   Actions: create new task and save changes, expand and collapse all
    the panels, copy tasks from another date and use templates.

In the central area, you will see the tasks stored in the currently
selected date, one panel per task. All panels have the same components,
some are used to fill the information about the task:

-   Time: fill the start and end dates in.
-   Project: project the task belongs to. You may search by the project
    or the customer name. There is one special entry in the combo box,
    *Load all projects*, that would let you load the complete list of
    projects in the system; users will only see projects they are
    assigned to by default.
-   Story: you can fill this field with a keyword to help you to
    differentiate tasks inside the same project.
-   Description: the big text area in the center can be used to write a
    description of the task.
-   Task type: select one of the types for additional info about the
    task.
-   Telework: flag to differentiate telework tasks.
-   Onsite: flag to differentiate on-site tasks.

Actions in task panels:

-   Delete: delete the task. Remember to save to do the actual deletion.
-   Clone: creates a new task with the same data and empty times.
-   Template: create a template based on that task. See [Using
    templates](tasks.md#using-templates) section below.
-   Collapse: the arrow icon in the top-right corner collapses the
    panel; it\'s useful to save vertical space when there are many
    tasks.

Below the list of tasks in the central area, there are two additional
buttons for *New task* and *Save changes*, for easy tab-navigation.
There are another two quick-access buttons to the next and previous
dates.

Managing tasks
--------------

When you open the screen, the current day will be selected; if you are
about to fill tasks for a different date select it from the calendar on
the left. Be careful, if there are unsaved changes, they will be lost
when you select a different date.

Fill the data of the empty task that pops up by default, and add any
number of new tasks using one of the two *New task* buttons. There are
more ways to create new tasks: using the clone button in a different
task, using a template button, or copying from another date. Repeat as
many times as you want until you have filled all the tasks of the day,
changes will be auto-saved every some seconds, there is a message in the
bottom bar that will let you know.

You can delete a task pressing the *Delete* button inside the task
panel; the panel disappears but the deletion won\'t be saved until you
do it manually with any of the two *Save* buttons.

Be careful with the start and end times of the dates, because they
can\'t overlap; if they do, tasks won\'t be saved until you correct the
problem and save again.

Using templates
---------------

Templates are useful when you create tasks with very similar data very
often. They are listed in the *Templates* section, in the bottom of the
left column. To create a new task from a template, click on the button
with the name of the template.

To add new templates to this list, first you have to create a task; fill
it in with the data you want to save as a template --- any field can be
saved, and none of them is compulsory; finally, click on the *Template*
button in the task box. You will be asked to provide a **name** for the
template, and when you confirm it will be added immediately to your
templates deck on the left side.

To delete a template, you only have to press the *Delete* button right
to the button with template name in the list.

There are two default templates that cannot be deleted:

-   *Full day task* will create a task and set its start and end times
    so it fills one full day of work. The values will be set according
    to the users\' journey values.
-   *Full-holiday task* works like the previous one, but will also set
    the project field to \'Holidays\'.

Copying tasks from another date
-------------------------------

A common scenario is having a person working in the same tasks for some
days, usually with the same timetable. The copy feature is useful in
this case.

In the actions box from the left column, there is a section named \'Copy
tasks from date\' containing a date selector and a \'Copy\' button. When
you press that button, the tasks saved in the indicated date will be
copied to the current date. Take into account that copied tasks aren\'t
saved until you press the save button.

The default date to copy from is the last date containing any recorded
tasks, that\'s the most common use case. Finally, we must clarify that
copied tasks can be modified without affecting the original ones.

Blocked tasks
-------------

Sometimes users won\'t be able to modify or delete some saved tasks, nor
even create new ones on certain dates. It can happen because of two
reasons:

-   Managers have closed a project. In that case, tasks assigned to that
    project cannot be altered.
-   Managers have blocked task reports for the selected date. In this
    case, even the *New task* and *Save changes* buttons would be
    blocked.

User work summary
-----------------

The *User work summary* panel on the left contains information on worked
hours, extra hours and holidays. Figures are presented in days, hours
and minutes, where a day is calculated based on the configured user
journey; e.g. for a 8-hour journey, 44 hours is 5 days, 4 hours.

Worked hours, today:

:   Number of hours worked today.

Worked hours, week:

:   Number of hours worked this week.

Worked hours, week goal:

:   Goal for the selected week.

    This value is calculated taking into account the users\' journey
    values and the amount of worked hours so far.

    By default, it represents **the number of hours users must work per
    week to finish the year with zero accumulated hours in that
    period.**

    For example, if you have worked some extra hours in the last weeks
    the weekly goal will become lower than your weekly schedule. This
    way you will have a way to know how to handle your time and finish
    the year with zero accumulated hours.

    Managers can customize per-user weekly goals with other time periods
    and amounts of hours different of zero. Read more about this in the
    [Setting user custom
    goals](users-management.md#setting-user-custom-goals) section.

Extra hours, year:

:   Number of extra hours corresponding to the current year.

Extra hours, total:

:   Number of historically accumulated extra hours.

Vacation days, available for year:

:   Holidays available to be used this year.

Vacation days, used:

:   Holidays already used in the year. More particularly, these are
    holidays **saved** for dates **in the past**.

Vacation days, scheduled:

:   Holidays scheduled for later in the year. More particularly, these
    are holidays **saved** for dates **in the future**.

Vacation days, pending:

:   Holidays pending to be scheduled or used. This is *(holidays
    available − used − scheduled)*.

Hotkeys
-------

Some hotkeys are available to increase the productivity for keyboard
users:

CTRL + S

:   Save changes. Some browsers don\'t allow to overwrite the behaviour
    of this key combination (e.g. Epiphany), so you can use ALT + S
    instead.

CTRL + N

:   Create a new task. The cursor will be placed in the first field of
    the new task. Some browsers don\'t allow to overwrite the behaviour
    of this key combination (e.g. Chrome), so you can use ALT + N,
    CTRL + U or ALT + U instead.

CTRL + number

:   The cursor will be placed in the first field of the first, second,
    third, etc. task depending on the number you pressed.

TAB

:   Advance to the next field.

SHIFT + TAB

:   Go back to the previous field.

LEFT, RIGHT

:   Jump to the previous or next date, when keyboard focus is not inside
    a field.
