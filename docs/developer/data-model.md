Data model

Design
------

The next diagram shows the theoretical vision of the data model, in
which the best practices related with the normalisation of the data have
been followed. However, the implementation contains a change that
contravenes these norms: the original primary keys of all the entities
have been replaced by numerical identifiers acting as keys. The reasons
of this change are, on the one hand, efficiency, avoiding the keys
formed by multiple attributes. On the other hand, convenience, since
these numerical keys can be autogenerated by the database. Besides,
numeric ids can be used to keep a reference between database objects and
external objects, for example, objects in a client application.

To describe in brief the model of data, we will mention the most
important entities and relations:

-   The entity *task* could consider the main object of the application,
    since the main purpose of PhpReport is to store, classify and
    extract information about tasks. It has important relations with
    *user* and *project*, that serve to classify the task.
-   The entity *user* is used mainly to control the access to the
    application, besides classifying tasks. There is a series of
    entities related with user that provide valuable information when
    they combine : the relations with *event*, *city\_history*,
    *journey\_history* do calculations on the working time, and
    *hour\_cost\_history* on the cost.
-   The entity *project* is used to classify and group tasks. It is
    interesting to mention the relation called *works* with *user*,
    which could be used to restrict the access to certain information in
    the application.
-   The entity *customer* classifies projects.
-   The entity *sector* classifies customers.
-   The entity *area* classifies projects and users. The relation
    between areas and users happens through the entity *area\_history*
    which stores the history of that user belonging to areas.
-   The entity *group* defines levels of access in the application.
-   The entity *extra\_hour* is used to reset the calculation of extra
    hours of an user in a determinate date.
-   The entity *event* provides basic support for work calendars. It
    stores a list of dates which are considered non work days in a
    certain city.
-   The entity *city* represents the city to which the worker is or has
    been assigned, through *city\_history*.

There are entities related with unimplemented features:

-   *Project\_schedule* to define project weekly schedules.
-   *Custom* events to define personal work calendars, independently
    from per-city calendars.
