# Setting up a development environment

Some steps described here overlap the ones described in the
[installation instructions](../admin/installation.md).

## Dependencies

Follow the corresponding section from the [installation
instructions](../admin/installation.md). Make sure to also install
_composer_ as specified there.

Additionally, a development environment may need the following
dependencies to generate minified versions of the JS code and the
documentation pages:

- Fedora: packages `uglify-js` and `python3-docutils`.
- Debian/Ubuntu: packages `uglifyjs` and `python3-docutils`.

NOTICE: UglifyJS version must be 3.15 or above.

For the React frontend, you will need to run `npm install` inside the `frontend` folder. Make sure that you have Node.js version 20 or higher.

For the Python API, make sure you have Python version 3.11 or higher.

## Setting up the database

From the `api` folder, run the migrations with

```
alembic upgrade head
```

Create a new migration with

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migrations description"
```

For more details check the alembic documentation.

## Setting up the files

Clone the PhpReport repository `https://github.com/Igalia/phpreport` in
a location available to the web server. The usual default location for
the Apache web server is: `/var/www/html/`

Alternatively, clone it elsewhere and create a link from the web server
directory.

You must also run `composer dump-autoload -o` inside PhpReport root
directory, so it can generate the autoload files. Then, run
`composer install` to install the project dependencies.

## Creating the schema and initial data of the database

The configuration file with the default values already exists in the
repository, so you don't have to touch it unless you changed any data
in the first step.

Then, you can follow the step three in the [installation
instructions](../admin/installation.md) (either the manual or the
wizard setup) to create the schema and initial data.

## Setup autogenerated files

You can optionally minify the JS source with `make minify`. You should
be able to debug it because there are source map files in place, but
take into account you would have to re-generate them with `make minify`
every time you modify a `.js` file. In a development environment, it's
probably better not to minify the sources.

## Create necessary .env files in your project

Using the .env.example as a template, create an .env at the root and one inside `frontend` and set the values to fit your environment.

## Running the API

Before you try the application, you'll want to get the API server running. To do so, follow the instructions in the [api documentation section](api.md)

## Running the frontend (React)

If you only want to want the React portion of the frontend and not the PHP portion, you can run `npm run dev` in the `frontend` folder. This will spin up a server at `http://localhost:5173/web/v2'

If you want to run everything together (exisiting PHP app, new API, and new frontend), it is easiest to run `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder. This will compile your JS to the `web/v2` folder.

## Try the application

Use a browser to open the correct URL of your web server (very likely,
`http://localhost/phpreport`), then use the user name `admin` and the
password `admin` to try a user with full privileges, or `user` with
password `user` to try a login with restricted permissions. You will
also be able to create users with any permission level once you are
logged in as `admin`.

## Running automated tests

There 2 types of tests in the project: unit and integration tests.

The unit tests will work locally without issues, but the integration
tests will only work if there is a service running on the port 8000 with
the data from the [sql/initialData.sql]{.title-ref} file. In that case
it's easier to run it with docker, as it has everything setup.

In one terminal build and run the application and the database:

`docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up --build --renew-anon-volumes`

In a second terminal run the `test` container to run the tests:

`docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run -T test`

If you don't want to setup docker, it's possible to run only the unit
tests. Make sure you have composer and the projects dependencies
installed. To install the dependencies run `composer install` in the
project root directory.

All the automated tests should be placed inside the `tests` directory.
From the project root, run `./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox tests/unit`
to execute the automated tests.

## Documentation

The application documentation is published using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). To preview the output of mdBook locally, ensure you have [mdBook installed](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html), then run `mdbook serve` at the root of the project.

API documentation is autogenerated using the OpenAPI standard. When running locally, you can view those docs at `http://localhost:8555/docs`. The FastAPI framework also provides docs at `http://localhost:8555/redoc` if you prefer ReDoc to Swagger.

## Linting and Formatting

The API uses Flake8 for linting and Black for formatting.

The frontend uses ESLint and Prettier.
